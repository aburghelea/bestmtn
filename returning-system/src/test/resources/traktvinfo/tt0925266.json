There are some conditions to this somewhat unusual talent. Ned quickly learns that if something is revived for more than exactly one minute, something of similar \"life value\" in the vicinity drops dead, as a form of balance. Additionally, if he touches the revived person or thing a second time, it falls dead again, this time permanently.","runtime":60,"status":"Ended","network":"ABC","air_day":"Wednesday","air_day_utc":"Wednesday","air_time":"8:00pm","air_time_utc":"5:00pm","certification":"TV-PG","imdb_id":"tt0925266","tvdb_id":80351,"tvrage_id":15716,"last_updated":1394806613,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/527.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/527.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/527.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/527.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":28,"username":"pt4117","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/pt4117"},{"plays":27,"username":"cnhome1","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/cnhome1"},{"plays":26,"username":"errorhead","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/errorhead"},{"plays":26,"username":"geebs61","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/geebs61"},{"plays":24,"username":"rb2k","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/rb2k"},{"plays":24,"username":"hansote","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/hansote"},{"plays":24,"username":"nukem4n","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/nukem4n"},{"plays":23,"username":"Technocoma","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1085.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Technocoma"},{"plays":23,"username":"manval","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/7030.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/manval"},{"plays":23,"username":"Whidmark","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/7089.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Whidmark"},{"plays":23,"username":"kriebe","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/28747.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/kriebe"},{"plays":23,"username":"repliknte","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/68767.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/repliknte"},{"plays":22,"username":"akuiraz","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/akuiraz"},{"plays":22,"username":"minipulator","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/minipulator"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":269,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Pie-lette","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/pushing-daisies/season/1/episode/1","first_aired":1191466800,"first_aired_iso":"2007-10-03T20:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1191456000},{"plays":209,"season":1,"number":2,"title":"Dummy","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/pushing-daisies/season/1/episode/2","first_aired":1192071600,"first_aired_iso":"2007-10-10T20:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1192060800},{"plays":186,"season":1,"number":4,"title":"Pigeon","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/pushing-daisies/season/1/episode/4","first_aired":1193281200,"first_aired_iso":"2007-10-24T20:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1193270400},{"plays":181,"season":1,"number":3,"title":"The
