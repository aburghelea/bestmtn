The Penguins will rule the roost at their Central Park Zoo home, doing secret missions in the heart of New York City. At times their secret missions beckon them to venture out of the zoo. Just as the team thinks it has its urban acreage under control, a new neighbor moves in next door: Julien, King of the Lemurs (who has come to New York in some way). Now the penguins must compete against him for the supreme leader of Central Park Zoo.","runtime":12,"status":"Continuing","network":"Nickelodeon","air_day":"Friday","air_day_utc":"Thursday","air_time":"12:00am","air_time_utc":"9:00pm","certification":"TV-Y7","imdb_id":"tt0892700","tvdb_id":85075,"tvrage_id":21572,"last_updated":1393532259,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/102.2.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/102.2.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/102.2.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/102.2.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":477,"username":"doctor64","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/doctor64"},{"plays":237,"username":"maciek0097","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/220715.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/maciek0097"},{"plays":196,"username":"TeMorituri","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/TeMorituri"},{"plays":186,"username":"MajorPDD","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/193790.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/MajorPDD"},{"plays":145,"username":"ltfearme","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/837.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ltfearme"},{"plays":136,"username":"mjstrong","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mjstrong"},{"plays":134,"username":"keva69","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/keva69"},{"plays":120,"username":"Hawkeye09","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/153926.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Hawkeye09"},{"plays":117,"username":"ankurs","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ankurs"},{"plays":112,"username":"dfullerman","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/dfullerman"},{"plays":102,"username":"slick74","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/slick74"},{"plays":100,"username":"praag","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/praag"},{"plays":98,"username":"TroublingWolf","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/TroublingWolf"},{"plays":86,"username":"strykr81","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/strykr81"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":215,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Gone

Skipper dives in and takes the hit for the commissioner, and his team is horrified at the resulting look of their leader.

However, the sheep, Randy, soon tells the penguins that he was provoked to bite the boy because the boy had, among other things, beaten on him and had pulled out a clump of his wool. Convinced that they had wrongly judged Randy, the penguins decide to help him out to prevent further abuse by rowdy children. When their attempts at applying a slippery polymer, building up static electricity on Randy's wool, and hypnosis fail, the penguins decide to transport Randy to a farm to live out the rest of his life. Randy is soon taken to a farm by the penguins in a truck, but shortly after his arrival, Randy is horrified at the appearance of the other sheep there, who are sheered and appear to be in a cult-like trance. Consequently, Randy ends up back at the petting zoo, but when the same boy approaches him to attack him again, Randy kicks him away.

As requested by Eggy's mother, the penguins agree to work with Eggy to convince him that he is not suited to engage in their para-military operations. But when he persists in desiring to become a commando, Skipper leads Eggy to believe that he needs to have a \"Penguin Commando License\" in order to partake in their operations, and that being able to tackle all the zoo has to offer is requisite for obtaining such. Although briefly successful, this plan soon backfires when Eggy begins to take down all the zoo animals, using the specialized characteristics of each of the penguins that he had learned from them while still in the egg state. Eventually, Julien is the last animal that Eggy had not yet beaten, and thus the only thing standing between him and his \"license.\" But Julien, upon learning that \"[his] J.J.\" (Eggy) wanted to become a penguin, begins dancing to music, and Eggy fails to bring him down as a result. Eggy is then cured of his commando desires but, to the dismay of the penguins, now has taken up Julien's behaviors.

Whilst attempting to do so at the photographer's house, however, Kowalski inadvertently sends an enlarged version of the incriminating area of the photo to the ad executives. Their situation is made progressively worse when their visit to the ad agency results in the photo being sent to the printer with the caption \"Killer Commando Penguins,\" and then when their attempt to reconfigure the 10,000-copy print job at the print shop instead results in a 1,000,000-copy authorization.
