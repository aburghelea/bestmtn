Set in Seattle, the story also explores local politics as it follows politicians connected to the case. As the series unfolds, it becomes clear that there are no accidents; everyone has a secret, and while the characters think they've moved on, their past isn't done with them.","runtime":60,"status":"Continuing","network":"Netflix","air_day":"Sunday","air_day_utc":"Sunday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"6:00pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt1637727","tvdb_id":210171,"tvrage_id":27387,"last_updated":1394887582,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/6159.5.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/6159.5.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/6159.5.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/6159.5.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":104,"username":"ltfearme","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/837.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ltfearme"},{"plays":65,"username":"myzac","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/myzac"},{"plays":60,"username":"micmeta","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/micmeta"},{"plays":55,"username":"johbra","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/15116.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/johbra"},{"plays":52,"username":"chrisyah","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/190445.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/chrisyah"},{"plays":48,"username":"Phixtit","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Phixtit"},{"plays":46,"username":"DanLongman","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/11488.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/DanLongman"},{"plays":46,"username":"jaysean","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/jaysean"},{"plays":46,"username":"KattoMaltes","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/38670.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/KattoMaltes"},{"plays":45,"username":"jedege","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/33591.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/jedege"},{"plays":43,"username":"Krizzii","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/21171.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Krizzii"},{"plays":43,"username":"tboggie","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/tboggie"},{"plays":43,"username":"segakin1978","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/149680.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/segakin1978"},{"plays":42,"username":"PeTeNet","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/2094.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/PeTeNet"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":934,"season":3,"number":1,"title":"The
