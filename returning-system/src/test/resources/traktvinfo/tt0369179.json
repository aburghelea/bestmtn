His casual Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly wound brother Alan, who's facing a divorce, and his son Jake, come to live with him. Together, these two and a half men confront the challenges of growing up; finally. Complicating matters are the brothers' self-obsessed, controlling mother, Evelyn, Alan's estranged wife, Judith and Charlie's crazy neighbor Rose, who wants to be a part of his life and is willing to do anything to be around. After the death of his brother, Alan Harper meets and befriends a lonely young man named Walden Schmidt who turns out to be a billionaire. Unable to afford his brother's home, Alan sells Walden the house, and as a way of showing his gratitude, Walden allows Alan and his son Jake to move in with him.","runtime":30,"status":"Continuing","network":"CBS","air_day":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Monday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"6:00pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt0369179","tvdb_id":72227,"tvrage_id":6454,"last_updated":1395011548,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/78.5.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/78.5.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/78.5.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/78.5.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":2385,"username":"RoChess","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1220.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/RoChess"},{"plays":780,"username":"firefist235","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/firefist235"},{"plays":707,"username":"dennisbjorkvall","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/dennisbjorkvall"},{"plays":645,"username":"Praest","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1744.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Praest"},{"plays":538,"username":"Lyfesaver","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/8552.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Lyfesaver"},{"plays":470,"username":"warrensh","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/warrensh"},{"plays":460,"username":"Ar-Kane","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/180902.3.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Ar-Kane"},{"plays":440,"username":"mcweinmann2","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mcweinmann2"},{"plays":439,"username":"tomerl225","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/tomerl225"},{"plays":413,"username":"muli24","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/20537.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/muli24"},{"plays":396,"username":"bloudicibobik","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1540.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/bloudicibobik"},{"plays":352,"username":"TRaymond","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/TRaymond"},{"plays":342,"username":"Acrimonis","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Acrimonis"},{"plays":339,"username":"SCMithrandir","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/SCMithrandir"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":1605,"season":11,"number":1,"title":"Nangnangnangnang","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/two-and-a-half-men/season/11/episode/1","first_aired":1380254400,"first_aired_iso":"2013-09-26T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1380243600},{"plays":1605,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Pilot","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/two-and-a-half-men/season/1/episode/1","first_aired":1064289600,"first_aired_iso":"2003-09-22T21:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1064278800},{"plays":1551,"season":11,"number":9,"title":"Numero
