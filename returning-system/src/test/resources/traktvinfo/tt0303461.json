But, the greatest danger of all may be on their ship.","first_aired":1128135600,"first_aired_iso":"2005-09-30T20:00:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1128124800,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/firefly/specials/episode/1","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/306-0-1.3.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/306-0-1.3.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":95,"votes":157,"loved":155,"hated":2}},{"season":0,"episode":2,"number":2,"tvdb_id":1000141,"title":"Here\u2019s How It Was: The Making of \u201cFirefly\u201d","overview":"Firefly Special Features from DVD/BluRay, Here\u2019s How It Was: The Making of \u201cFirefly\u201d","first_aired":1071028800,"first_aired_iso":"2003-12-09T20:00:00-05:00","first_aired_utc":1071018000,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/firefly/specials/episode/2","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/306-0-2.3.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/306-0-2.3.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":90,"votes":26,"loved":25,"hated":1}},{"season":0,"episode":3,"number":3,"tvdb_id":967981,"title":"Done the Impossible","overview":"\"Done the Impossible\" is a documentary fan film of the TV series \"Firefly\".
