Many animals and plants go to extremes to give themselves a chance.\n\nUniquely, three brother cheetahs band together to bring down a huge ostrich. Aerial photography reveals how bottle-nosed dolphins trap fish in a ring of mud, and timelapse cameras show how the Venus flytrap ensnares insect victims. The Strawberry frog carries a tadpole high into a tree and drops it in a water-filled bromeliad. The frog must climb back from the ground every day to feed it. Fledgling chinstrap penguins undertake a heroic and tragic journey through the broken ice to get out to sea. Many can barely swim and the formidable leopard seal lies in wait.","first_aired":1255406400,"first_aired_iso":"2009-10-12T21:00:00+01:00","first_aired_utc":1255377600,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/1","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-1.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-1.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":90,"votes":52,"loved":52,"hated":0}},{"season":1,"episode":2,"number":2,"tvdb_id":1185081,"title":"Reptiles and Amphibians","overview":"Reptiles and amphibians look like hang-overs from the past. But they overcome their shortcomings through amazing innovation.\n\nThe pebble toad turns into a rubber ball to roll and bounce from its enemies. Extreme slow-motion shows how a Jesus Christ lizard runs on water, and how a chameleon fires an extendable tongue at its prey with unfailing accuracy. The camera dives with a Niuean sea snake, which must breed on land but avoids predators by swimming to an air bubble at the end of an underwater tunnel. In a TV first, komodo dragons hunt a huge water-buffalo, biting it to inject venom, then waiting for weeks until it dies. Ten dragons strip the carcass to the bone in four hours.","first_aired":1256011200,"first_aired_iso":"2009-10-19T21:00:00+01:00","first_aired_utc":1255982400,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/2","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-2.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-2.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":94,"votes":45,"loved":45,"hated":0}},{"season":1,"episode":3,"number":3,"tvdb_id":1185091,"title":"Mammals","overview":"Mammals dominate the planet. They do it through having warm blood and by the care they lavish on their young. Weeks of filming in the bitter Antarctic winter reveal how a mother Weddell seal wears her teeth down keeping open a hole in the ice so she can catch fish for her pup.\n\nA powered hot air balloon produces stunning images of millions of migrating bats as they converge on fruiting trees in Zambia, and slow-motion cameras reveal how a mother rufous sengi exhausts a chasing lizard. A gyroscopically stabilised camera moves alongside migrating caribou, and a diving team swim among the planet's biggest fight as male humpback whales battle for a female.","first_aired":1256616000,"first_aired_iso":"2009-10-26T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1256590800,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/3","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-3.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-3.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":93,"votes":43,"loved":43,"hated":0}},{"season":1,"episode":4,"number":4,"tvdb_id":1185101,"title":"Fish","overview":"Fish dominate the planet's waters through their astonishing variety of shape and behaviour.\n\nThe beautiful weedy sea dragon looks like a creature from a fairytale, and the male protects their eggs by carrying them on his tail for months. The sarcastic fringehead, meanwhile, appears to turn its head inside out when it fights.\n\nSlow-motion cameras show the flying fish gliding through the air like a flock of birds and capture the world's fastest swimmer, the sailfish, plucking sardines from a shoal at 100 mph. And the tiny Hawaiian goby undertakes one of nature's most daunting journeys, climbing a massive waterfall to find safe pools for breeding.","first_aired":1257224400,"first_aired_iso":"2009-11-02T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1257195600,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/4","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-4.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-4.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":88,"votes":38,"loved":38,"hated":0}},{"season":1,"episode":5,"number":5,"tvdb_id":1185111,"title":"Birds","overview":"Birds owe their global success to feathers - something no other animal has.

Aerial photography takes us into the sky with an Ethiopian Lammergeier dropping bones to smash them into edible-sized bits. Thousands of pink flamingoes promenade in one of nature's greatest spectacles. The Sage Grouse rubs his feathers against his chest in a comic display to make popping noises that attract females. The Vogelkop Bowerbird makes up for his dull colour by building an intricate structure and decorating it with colourful beetles and snails.","first_aired":1257829200,"first_aired_iso":"2009-11-09T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1257800400,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/5","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-5.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-5.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":87,"votes":32,"loved":31,"hated":1}},{"season":1,"episode":6,"number":6,"tvdb_id":1185121,"title":"Insects","overview":"There are 200 million insects for each of us.

The camera flies with millions of monarch butterflies which migrate 2000 miles, navigating by the sun. Super-slow motion shows a bombardier beetle firing boiling liquid at enemies through a rotating nozzle. A honey bee army stings a raiding bear into submission.\n\nGrass cutter ants march like a Roman army, harvesting grass they cannot actually eat. They cultivate a fungus that breaks the grass down for them. Their giant colony is the closest thing in nature to the complexity of a human city.","first_aired":1258434000,"first_aired_iso":"2009-11-16T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1258405200,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/6","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-6.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-6.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":92,"votes":21,"loved":21,"hated":0}},{"season":1,"episode":7,"number":7,"tvdb_id":1185131,"title":"Hunters and Hunted","overview":"Mammals' ability to learn new tricks is the key to survival in the knife-edge world of hunters and hunted.

Young ibex soon learn the only way to escape a fox - run up an almost vertical cliff face - and young stoats fight mock battles, learning the skills that make them one of the world's most efficient predators.","first_aired":1258952400,"first_aired_iso":"2009-11-22T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1258923600,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/7","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-7.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-7.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":86,"votes":32,"loved":30,"hated":2}},{"season":1,"episode":8,"number":8,"tvdb_id":1185141,"title":"Creatures of the Deep","overview":"Marine invertebrates are some of the most bizarre and beautiful animals on the planet, and thrive in the toughest parts of the oceans.\n\nDivers swim into a shoal of predatory Humboldt squid as they emerge from the ocean depths to hunt in packs.

Time-lapse photography reveals thousands of starfish gathering under the Arctic ice to devour a seal carcass.\n\nA giant octopus commits suicide for her young.

Vines develop suckers and claws to haul themselves into the rainforest canopy. Every peculiar shape proves to have a clever purpose. The dragon's blood tree is like an upturned umbrella to capture mist and shade its roots. The seed of a Bornean tree has wings so aerodynamic they inspired the design of early gliders. The barrel-shaped desert rose is full of water. The heliconia plant even enslaves a humming bird and turns it into an addict for its nectar.","first_aired":1260248400,"first_aired_iso":"2009-12-07T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1260219600,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/9","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-9.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-9.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":88,"votes":29,"loved":28,"hated":1}},{"season":1,"episode":10,"number":10,"tvdb_id":1185161,"title":"Primates","overview":"Intelligence and adaptability allow primates to tackle the many challenges of life, and this is what makes our closest relatives so successful. This resourcefulness has enabled primates to conquer an incredible diversity of habitat. Hamadryas baboons live on the open plains of Ethiopia in groups up to 400 strong. Strength in numbers gives them some protection from potential predators. But, should their path cross with other baboon troops, it can lead to all-out battle, as males try to steal females from one another, and even settle old scores. Japanese macaques are the most northerly-dwelling primates and they experience completely different challenges. Some beat the freezing conditions by having access to a thermal spa in the middle of winter. But this privilege is only for those born of the right female bloodline. For western lowland gorillas, it's the male silverback that leads his family group in the rich forests of the Congo basin. He advertises his status to all with a powerful chest-beating display. Most primates are forest dwellers, and one of the strangest is the tarsier \u2013 the only purely carnivorous primate. As it hunts for insects the tarsier leaps from tree to tree in the dead of night, using its huge forward-facing eyes to safely judge each jump. Good communication is essential for success in primate society.","first_aired":1260853200,"first_aired_iso":"2009-12-14T21:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1260824400,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1/episode/10","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-10.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/46-1-10.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":91,"votes":25,"loved":25,"hated":0}}],"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/life-2009/season/1","poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/seasons/46-1.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/seasons/46-1.jpg"}}]}
