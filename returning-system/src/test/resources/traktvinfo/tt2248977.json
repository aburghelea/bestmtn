Both have found joy in their love lives: Joe is newly engaged to Ali, while Louis is dating Wyatt. As news of Joe\u2019s engagement settles, time will tell if their business and personal bond can adapt to the addition of two other important relationships.","runtime":30,"status":"Ended","network":"CBS","air_day":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Monday","air_time":"8:30pm","air_time_utc":"5:30pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt2248977","tvdb_id":259092,"tvrage_id":30810,"last_updated":1393937288,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/16927.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/16927.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/16927.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/16927.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":15,"username":"Barnhart1310","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/9613.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Barnhart1310"},{"plays":14,"username":"chinchin","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/chinchin"},{"plays":13,"username":"goodevilgenius","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/6975.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/goodevilgenius"},{"plays":13,"username":"evert23","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/21247.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/evert23"},{"plays":13,"username":"mitencetoy","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/43307.4.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mitencetoy"},{"plays":12,"username":"z3r0_burn","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/2476.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/z3r0_burn"},{"plays":12,"username":"khouryrt","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/khouryrt"},{"plays":12,"username":"kritika.singhania","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/kritika.singhania"},{"plays":11,"username":"Dictator","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Dictator"},{"plays":11,"username":"dayvid","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/41747.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/dayvid"},{"plays":11,"username":"lstg","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/48626.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/lstg"},{"plays":10,"username":"yamba","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/yamba"},{"plays":9,"username":"AlainH","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/55711.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/AlainH"},{"plays":9,"username":"darefjell","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/darefjell"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":235,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Pilot","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/partners-2012/season/1/episode/1","first_aired":1348543800,"first_aired_iso":"2012-09-24T20:30:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1348533000},{"plays":167,"season":1,"number":2,"title":"Chicken
