A successful surgeon until she lost a patient and her license three years ago, Watson views her current job as another opportunity to help people, as well as paying a penance. Holmes resumes his work as a police consultant in New York City and Watson has no choice but to accompany her irascible new charge on his jobs. But Sherlock finds her medical background helpful, and Watson realizes she has a knack for playing investigator.\n\nWith the mischievous Sherlock Holmes now running free in New York solving crimes, it\u2019s simple deduction that he\u2019s going to need someone to keep him grounded, and it\u2019s elementary that it\u2019s a job for Watson.
