Shy Norman is reluctant at first, but with the help of his mother -- with whom he shares an intensely close relationship -- the boy begins to open up to others and make new friends. Some locals, however, aren't as friendly and welcoming to the Bates, who discover that because White Pine Bay isn't as peaceful as it appears, they are forced to do whatever it takes to survive.","runtime":60,"status":"Continuing","network":"A&E","air_day":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Monday","air_time":"9:00pm","air_time_utc":"6:00pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt2188671","tvdb_id":262414,"tvrage_id":32210,"last_updated":1394966244,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/18498.16.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/18498.16.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/18498.16.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/18498.16.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":26,"username":"bubas4ever","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/bubas4ever"},{"plays":26,"username":"Ro_man","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Ro_man"},{"plays":22,"username":"rosterloh","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/23442.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/rosterloh"},{"plays":22,"username":"dylanobriens","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/181859.8.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/dylanobriens"},{"plays":20,"username":"aFreak","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/aFreak"},{"plays":19,"username":"riverboat2001","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/137220.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/riverboat2001"},{"plays":19,"username":"araujulio","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/155901.12.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/araujulio"},{"plays":19,"username":"jvandenbroek","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/jvandenbroek"},{"plays":18,"username":"tammer","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/tammer"},{"plays":16,"username":"oldmangloom","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/39695.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/oldmangloom"},{"plays":16,"username":"jmonferr","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/jmonferr"},{"plays":16,"username":"ath3na","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/56744.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ath3na"},{"plays":15,"username":"jrhames","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/2037.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/jrhames"},{"plays":15,"username":"Biomanniax","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Biomanniax"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":1466,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"First
