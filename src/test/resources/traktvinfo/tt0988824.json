Naruto vs. Itachi","overview":"As the travel slowly towards and unknown destination, Nagato and Itachi wonder who they were going to be forced to fight. Sensing a nostalgic presence only to be greeted by Naruto who is accompanied by Killer B. Their reunion conversation, however, is cut short when Kabuto \u2014 thrilled by the prospect of capturing the Eight and Nine-Tails \u2014 commanded Itachi to attack. Slicing through the enormous fireball launched at them using Samehada, B later has to apologise to the sentient blade who did not appreciate being used to absorb hot flames. Moving-in, Itachi clashes with Naruto while they converse about Sasuke. Revealing to Itachi that he knew the truth behind the Uchiha Clan Massacre, a shocked Itachi questions how far this news had spread and upon hearing that only a few people knew, requested that it stay that way. Though puzzled, Nagato was forced to attack and the battle between the four shinobi ensue. Retreating atop Nagato's Giant Drill-Beaked Bird, Itachi activates his Mangeky\u014d Sharingan causing one of his crows to emerged from a shocked Naruto's mouth. Casting Amaterasu, Itachi incinerates Nagato's summons as well as Nagato himself, telling the Rinnegan-wielder that his plan had worked. It is revealed that the crow had Shisui Uchiha's Mangeky\u014d Sharingan implanted in its eye socket and the eye was rigged to react to Itachi's eyes and cast Kotoamatsukami: which had the order \"protect Konoha\". Now freed from Kabuto's control, Itachi explains that this was the power he had given to Naruto and had intended for it to be used on his brother. During this explanation, however, Nagato's corpse was able to regenerate and Kabuto, excited by the prospect of acquiring Shisui's DNA, had Nagato attack once again. Hidden in his Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, Nagato surprises the group launching a large-scaled Shinra Tensei before targeting B who throttles him in Version 2 only to have Nagato absorb his chakra, restoring him to his youthful-looking self. With this, Nagato captures Naruto and prepares to remove his soul.

B arrives at their location and attempts a surprise attack but it is foiled by the shared field-of-vision Nagato has with the Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon and the King of Hell which had been summoned to store the young man's soul. In the clutches of Nagato's mechanical arms with a cannon pointing at him in point-blank range, the two jinch\u016briki are saved by Itachi and his Susanoo. Nagato, however, quickly regenerates and uses Chibaku Tensei with the intent of crushing his targets into the planetary body. Though Naruto raised the alarm that there was little they could do against this technique, Itachi rallies the group and has them use their most powerful long ranged attacks to target the center of the sphere, effectively neutralizing the attack. In the aftermath of this, Itachi is able to pierce Nagato with his Totsuka Sword freeing the Rinnegan-wielder from Kabuto's control. With the time he had left, Nagato lamented the fact that he had sullied the brilliant legacy their master had left behind and told Naruto to be the most amazing end to the trilogy that he could be. With this, Naruto tries to move out to the battlefield, but his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode wears off leading Itachi to tell him to not rely solely on his own power, but to put some trust in his comrades and their own power. After telling B to take care of Naruto, he incinerates the crow with Shisui's Sharingan and departs to deal with the person controlling the reincarnated shinobi.

One of Naruto's clones appears and saves Shino from falling into Torune's kinjutsu.

With the warning to not touch Torune's skin, Naruto starts fighting the reincarnated opponent, who tries to use kenjutsu against him, though Naruto succeeds in breaking his sword. Naruto manages to land a Rasengan, and Torune almost lands a punch on him, failing due to Shino putting himself in between them, taking the hit.

This is because Konoha nearly destroyed the Sky Country during the last Shinobi World War. However, they survived and now are after Konoha and the Fire Country for revenge.\n\nThe group starts attacking Konoha causing mass mayhem, with flying ninjas on winged-mechanical devices bombarding the village. A boy comes all the way to inform Konoha that his village had been attacked and he was looking for his sensei, who was currently in Konoha, to go with him to heal the injured at his village.\n\nA 3 man team consisting of Naruto, Sakura and Hinata are sent along to help the boy's village and they accompany Amaru, the boy and Shinnou his sensei back to the village. The team travel through a forest full of eerie beasts and poisonous animals by small rowing boats down a river. A Sora-Nin suddenly appears and they hide by the riverside with Naruto and Amaru hiding underwater until the Sora-Nin goes. When they resurface, Amaru gets caught in the weeds underwater and loses his precious scalpel (a present from his beloved sensei). While helping Amaru with the weeds, Naruto notices that Amaru is in fact a \"she\" due to her breasts present. Naruto blushes while at the same time, a poisonous piranha-like fish bites him and he faints. Later on, Naruto wakes up still blushing, also because Amaru was sucking the poisonous blood out of the wound on his thigh thus saving Naruto. Naruto asks her if he's a \"she\" and suggests that Amaru has feelings for her sensei and he gets slapped.\n\nMeanwhile at Konoha, the Sora-nin retreats because they were out of chakra to maintain flying, so Konoha sends another special team to look for their base. Sai approaches the ships which is near the beach on one of his ink birds to attract attention while Shikamaru and Kakashi hides behind some rocks near the shore waiting for the right time to infiltrate and attack. At Orochimaru's lair, Orochimaru is now ill because the body transfer jutsu he uses is close to expiration. Kabuto is attending to him and tells Sasuke that the Sora-nin is attacking Konoha to which Sasuke gives an \"I don't care\" reply. Orochimaru orders Sasuke to get a man who is able to help him perfect his reincarnation jutsu.\n\nNaruto and company finally reach Amaru's village to find that the village had been badly attacked and some parts are now in ruins with the inhabitants nowhere to be seen. Amaru cries and runs around trying to find some villages she unknowingly triggered a trap with a bunch of kunai flying towards her, her sensei Shinnou steps in and protects her but fails. Naruto, Sakura and Hinata run to the scene but it was too late, Shinnou dies. After Amaru comes to her senses they continue to look for villages. Sasuke is on his way to the village.\n\nLater on through a series of events Hinata gets separated from Sakura and Naruto. Naruto and Sakura find themselves in front of an evil monster that claims to be a bijuu, the Zero Tails, who feeds on the darkness of human souls and somehow took over Amaru. Sakura proves to be no match for the beast, the creature senses that Naruto has a huge dark energy/power inside of him so it taunts Naruto and tries to make him use that power, saying \"He cannot save anyone without it\" this makes Naruto remember about his failure in saving Sasuke and is emotionally unstable taking on the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form, eventually the four tails state. After fighting for a while, he turns back to normal when the seal which Jiraiya gave to Naruto activates and removes Kyuubi's chakra.\n\nNaruto tells Amaru to ignore the darkness in her heart which finally resulted in the beast getting defeated. Sakura wakes up in Naruto's arms and punches him - awkwardly. They decided to separate with Naruto going on to look for the villagers and Hinata and Sakura going back to get help. Amaru, who was supposed to go with Sakura stays to help Naruto. They then found some old ruins in which Shinnou mentioned earlier and enters the ruins. Shinnou is inside - safe and sound saying something about conquering the world with the power of darkness. Amaru, excited that her sensei is alive runs to hug him, Naruto notices something's not right and Shinnou laughs at Amaru for trusting him. Shinnou tells that he's been researching on the power of darkness for about 15 years and he's finally found it in Konoha now he only needs secret scroll with a reincarnation jutsu or something written on it. He then tranforms with his hair standing up and some physical changes in him. Naruto charges towards him only to be outmatched again and again, beating Naruto badly.\n\nShinnou also tries to convince Naruto to use the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's chakra. Amaru cries while Shinnou and Naruto duke it out. When she was small, she suffered from a strange illness. No one liked her, fearing that they'll be infected. Only Shinnou cared for her and managed to cure her. Naruto tells her not to throw her feelings away while the evil Shinnou mocks her. She finally admits her love and feelings to Shinnou, causing him to laugh and allowing Naruto to land a hit. Naruto then manages to gain the upperhand in the fight.He was about to finish him off with resagen when sasuke appears and intervenes with naruto's resagen. Saskue than says \"Orochimaru needs help with a reincarnation jutsu\" to Shinnou and Shinnou gives him a scroll. At first Shinnou refuses to do anything and tries to defeat Sasuke with dark charkra. Sasuke then reveals he attacked with Chidori Senbon early while fighting Naruto which attacks Shinnou's cells and cut off his chakra flow. This has a side effect of turning Shinnou back to normal ,who then flees the scene and Sasuke after him. Naruto tells Amaru to go find the villagers while he goes after Sasuke. He finds Sasuke in a room and asks him \"What are you doing here?\". In the same room is a cocoon which is absorbing dark chakra, Shinnou fuses with the cocoon and attacks Naruto and Sasuke with tentacle arms and captures them. Shinnou tries to absorb their chakra, Sasuke turns to Curse Seal level 1 and releases evil chakra and Naruto who got Sasuke's plan turns to his Nine-Tailed Demon Fox form sending a lot of chakra. After Naruto breaks free he makes kyuubi chakra-infused rasengan and attacks. The cocoon creature puts up a shield which Naruto and him reach a stalement. The kyuubi chakra cut Sasukes restraints and he then ascends to Curse Seal Level 2. and cuts down the shield thus allowing Naruto to finish off the creature with rasengan. After that he and Sasuke escape.\n\nIn the meantime, Konoha successfully infiltrates the Sora-nin's base. Amaru finds Hinata and the villagers in a cell and frees them all and going off in lifeboats. Naruto appears again and orders Amaru to go, she refuses and Sasuke throws her in by force. As the lifeboat leaves tentacles reach to grab it but saskue cuts it down. Naruto smiles, and also forces Sasuke onto the lifeboat with Rasengan (Naruto whispers something to Sasuke) who then escapes. Remembering Jiraiya once said that Naruto had the willpower to never give up, he creates some shadow clones and start to destroy the ruins. When all was destroyed, he collapsed. Amaru, from a distance, sees Naruto and grabs a pair of Sora-nin wings and goes towards him. Upon reaching him, she grabs him and they fall together. Jiraiya suddenly pops out with Gamabunta and catches the two, thus saving them.\n\nLater on, Naruto wakes up in Amaru's arms. Sasuke goes back and gives Orochimaru the scroll, who then asks if something good had happened. Sasuke then goes off to train and remembers Naruto's whisper, \"I'll definitely bring you back to Konoha, Sasuke!\"","first_aired":1217730600,"first_aired_iso":"2008-08-02T19:30:00+09:00","first_aired_utc":1217673000,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/naruto-shippuuden/specials/episode/2","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/307-0-2.2.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/307-0-2.2.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":72,"votes":10,"loved":9,"hated":1}},{"season":0,"episode":3,"number":3,"tvdb_id":2107441,"title":"Naruto Shippuuden 3: Inheritors of the Will of Fire","overview":"Across the great shinobi nations, ninja with special bloodline limits have gone missing without a trace.
