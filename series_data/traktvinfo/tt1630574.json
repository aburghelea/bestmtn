The firm is led by OZ, a larger-than-life head honcho who is a man of mystery and master of manipulation. The members of the odd squad include alluring bad girl Melanie, who is in charge of lock-picking, safe-cracking and heart-breaking; and Cash, a fanboy who specializes in strategy, logistics and office pranks only a mad genius could think up.\n\nOz's newest recruit, plucked right out of college, is lovable and charming computer hacker Cameron Price. Unfortunately for Cameron, cracking into state-of-the-art security systems is a lot easier than dealing with his co-workers. Between Melanie's sex appeal and Cash's hazing, Cameron has more than a few obstacles to overcome if he wants to cement his status as part of the team and become Oz's go-to guy.","runtime":30,"status":"Ended","network":"FOX","air_day":"Wednesday","air_day_utc":"Wednesday","air_time":"9:30pm","air_time_utc":"6:30pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt1630574","tvdb_id":206751,"tvrage_id":26082,"last_updated":1393019087,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/7418.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/7418.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/7418.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/7418.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":57,"username":"CoinTos","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1297.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/CoinTos"},{"plays":35,"username":"nmachine","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/nmachine"},{"plays":33,"username":"Cyrakrum","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/14619.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Cyrakrum"},{"plays":27,"username":"mcdonagg","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mcdonagg"},{"plays":25,"username":"spideronfire","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/8934.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/spideronfire"},{"plays":23,"username":"elchook","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/elchook"},{"plays":23,"username":"mellet","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/27933.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mellet"},{"plays":23,"username":"StrohhutMicha","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/StrohhutMicha"},{"plays":21,"username":"SimonBell","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/SimonBell"},{"plays":21,"username":"ako","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ako"},{"plays":21,"username":"segakin1978","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/149680.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/segakin1978"},{"plays":20,"username":"ShakeSpeer","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1000.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/ShakeSpeer"},{"plays":20,"username":"Cavalera","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1389.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Cavalera"},{"plays":20,"username":"mrwebsmith","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mrwebsmith"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":521,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Pilot","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/breaking-in/season/1/episode/1","first_aired":1302150600,"first_aired_iso":"2011-04-06T21:30:00-04:00","first_aired_utc":1302139800},{"plays":492,"season":1,"number":2,"title":"Tis
