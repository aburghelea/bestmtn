Helping them are a team of Poles.\n\nAs the team's only 'country bumpkin' Hammond is the team leader. However, his garden plan fails to impress Clarkson and May, who want to include a water feature and a shed, respectively. They are sent to a Wyevale Garden Centre to pick up supplies, returning with their desired equipment.\n\nHammond uses a small digger to dig a trench, to be used to create a 'river of gravel.' Clarkson earlier revealed his unique method for pulling up weeds and cutting branches off trees using a shotgun. Hammond's digger topples over in the trench, so he returns with a much larger digger to pull it out, resulting in leaving numerous Caterpillar tracks marks all over the garden. Meanwhile, James and the Poles have completed the shed.\n\nHammond's tree seat is completed. He brings in a 14 tone crane to hook the seat so he could slip it over the tree. Despite the machine getting stuck, the crane is long enough to hook onto the seat. Because he had not got the hang of the crane, he accidentally swished it sideways, destroying both the shed and the seat.\n\nClarkson decides to remove a rockery by using a homemade bomb. During the explosion one wall of the shed James built is smashed. After this happens May steps out of the shed with a plank of wood, and asks what time the programme will air. After being informed it was going to air after the watershed, he exclaims 'you're a fu-'. At this point, the episode cuts to the next scene.\n\nJeremy orders some cement to pave over the garden, but he orders too little, and only a small portion of the garden is covered. Hammond gets stuck in the cement, and Jeremy lifts him out. James' shed is destroyed for the third time when Jeremy erects some rugby posts (despite the fact that none of Sir Stephen Redgrave's family plays rugby). However, he and the Poles accidentally drop the posts. This lead to James angrily telling Clarkson to apologize while pointing the plank of wood at Clarkson. Hammond reveals his barbecue system, which uses a jet engine to rotate the meat and cook it. However, the blades rotate too fast and the fire from the engine sets James' newly-rebuilt shed on fire. They would have been able to extinguish the fire if May and Clarkson hadn't fought over the fire extinguisher.\n\nThe team then received word that Sir Steve Redgrave was coming up the drive to the house. Redgrave is upset at the destruction of his garden, so the Poles run away. Eventually he comes around thanks to Jeremy talking to him privately. Jeremy then shows off his turbo-charged water feature, which blows the top off itself due to the water pressure and crashes into the greenhouse built by the Poles, breaking all the glass. Until then, the greenhouse was the only structure still intact.","first_aired":1205550000,"first_aired_iso":"2008-03-14T20:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1205524800,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/top-gear/specials/episode/20","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/7-0-20.8.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/7-0-20.8.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":92,"votes":11,"loved":11,"hated":0}},{"season":0,"episode":21,"number":21,"tvdb_id":380212,"title":"Series 11 Best of","overview":"Highlights from Season 11","first_aired":1218682800,"first_aired_iso":"2008-08-13T20:00:00+01:00","first_aired_utc":1218654000,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/top-gear/specials/episode/21","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/7-0-21.8.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/7-0-21.8.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":90,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0}},{"season":0,"episode":22,"number":22,"tvdb_id":419965,"title":"Series 12 Best of (1)","overview":"Richard Hammond and James May travel to the Riviera to race a classic Ferrari Daytona against a state of the art powerboat. \n\nMeanwhile, Jeremy Clarkson conducts a 'serious' road test of the new Ford Fiesta - with a little help from the Royal Marines.","first_aired":1230868800,"first_aired_iso":"2009-01-01T20:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1230840000,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/top-gear/specials/episode/22","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/7-940.8.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/7-940.8.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":95,"votes":2,"loved":2,"hated":0}},{"season":0,"episode":23,"number":23,"tvdb_id":420272,"title":"Series 12 Best of (2)","overview":"A special featuring a selection of highlights from Top Gear in 2008.

The aim: to select the ideal mode of transport for each leg of a pilgrimage from Venice, Italy to Pau in France \u2013 home to a legendary street circuit and the origins of Grand Prix racing. On the way we prepare by taking to the track at Monza \u2013 the home of Italian Formula One. We try to get noticed on the road course in Monaco in a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Model T Ford. After cruising the canals in Venice we take to the tarmac and things look good - thanks to the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS Black. Throw in a Pagani Huayra, Porsche Cayman S and a GT3 as well as the Aston Martin Vanquish centenary edition, Bentley V8 convertible, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe and the face-bending BAC Mono all seems pretty perfect to us. There\u2019s culture too. An all-out effort to get the Birmingham burger-boy to savour the culinary delights of Italy and France \u2013 including octopus and an old balcony. Then it\u2019s time to turn up the heat even more with a Top Gear race... and the worst forfeit in television history Finally we head to the historic road course in Pau. Surely nothing could spoil our Perfect Road Trip... Enjoy...!

The aim: to select the ideal mode of transport for each leg of a pilgrimage from Venice, Italy to Pau in France \u2013 home to a legendary street circuit and the origins of Grand Prix racing. On the way we prepare by taking to the track at Monza \u2013 the home of Italian Formula One. We try to get noticed on the road course in Monaco in a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Model T Ford. After cruising the canals in Venice we take to the tarmac and things look good - thanks to the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS Black. Throw in a Pagani Huayra, Porsche Cayman S and a GT3 as well as the Aston Martin Vanquish centenary edition, Bentley V8 convertible, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe and the face-bending BAC Mono all seems pretty perfect to us. There\u2019s culture too. An all-out effort to get the Birmingham burger-boy to savour the culinary delights of Italy and France \u2013 including octopus and an old balcony. Then it\u2019s time to turn up the heat even more with a Top Gear race... and the worst forfeit in television history Finally we head to the historic road course in Pau.
