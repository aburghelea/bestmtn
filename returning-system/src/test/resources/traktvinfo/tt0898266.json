But none of that genius helps them interact with people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty named Penny moves in next door. Sheldon, Leonard's roommate, is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow CalTech scientists Howard Wolowitz and Raj Koothrappali. However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities... including love.","runtime":30,"status":"Continuing","network":"CBS","air_day":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Monday","air_time":"8:00pm","air_time_utc":"5:00pm","certification":"TV-PG","imdb_id":"tt0898266","tvdb_id":80379,"tvrage_id":8511,"last_updated":1395036031,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/34.66.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/34.66.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/34.66.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/34.66.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":4376,"username":"murgers","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/murgers"},{"plays":3983,"username":"Orange","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/6202.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Orange"},{"plays":2843,"username":"benrom","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/benrom"},{"plays":2538,"username":"Quoccus","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Quoccus"},{"plays":2359,"username":"milhouse","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/57711.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/milhouse"},{"plays":2299,"username":"wishywashy","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/wishywashy"},{"plays":2145,"username":"RoChess","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1220.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/RoChess"},{"plays":2130,"username":"Multimedia","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Multimedia"},{"plays":2051,"username":"Barnhart1310","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/9613.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Barnhart1310"},{"plays":1829,"username":"Cryic","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Cryic"},{"plays":1667,"username":"xAhlen","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/xAhlen"},{"plays":1505,"username":"siriusn","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/siriusn"},{"plays":1496,"username":"lorddunlow","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/24743.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/lorddunlow"},{"plays":1379,"username":"RealElmo","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/1438.3.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/RealElmo"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":7078,"season":7,"number":1,"title":"The
