He went much further though and was sucked down a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy and into the middle of a battle. He was rescued by a group of escaping prisoners and taken aboard their living ship. As the years went by, Crichton has made enemies, powerful and dangerous enemies. On his journey to find a way back home, he freed other captives who became part of the crew on Moya.","runtime":60,"status":"Ended","network":"SciFi","air_day":"Monday","air_day_utc":"Sunday","air_time":"12:00am","air_time_utc":"9:00pm","certification":"TV-14","imdb_id":"tt0187636","tvdb_id":70522,"tvrage_id":3519,"last_updated":1394961399,"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/149.jpg","images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/149.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/149.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/149.jpg"},"top_watchers":[{"plays":261,"username":"mackal","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/mackal"},{"plays":159,"username":"Oppenheimer","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Oppenheimer"},{"plays":144,"username":"fyyrest0rm","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/fyyrest0rm"},{"plays":138,"username":"werxie","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/werxie"},{"plays":135,"username":"argypak","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/argypak"},{"plays":124,"username":"Ar-Kane","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/180902.3.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Ar-Kane"},{"plays":118,"username":"MrMjolnir","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/MrMjolnir"},{"plays":113,"username":"Shidojin","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/36102.1.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/Shidojin"},{"plays":97,"username":"feerlessleadr","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/324.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/feerlessleadr"},{"plays":97,"username":"webrider1973","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/webrider1973"},{"plays":95,"username":"segakin1978","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatars/149680.2.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/segakin1978"},{"plays":94,"username":"almi","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/almi"},{"plays":92,"username":"aselby","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/aselby"},{"plays":92,"username":"billmanz","protected":false,"full_name":null,"gender":null,"age":"","location":null,"about":null,"joined":0,"avatar":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/avatar-large.jpg","url":"http://trakt.tv/user/billmanz"}],"top_episodes":[{"plays":391,"season":1,"number":1,"title":"Premiere","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/farscape/season/1/episode/1","first_aired":921830400,"first_aired_iso":"1999-03-19T00:00:00-05:00","first_aired_utc":921819600},{"plays":305,"season":1,"number":2,"title":"Exodus
