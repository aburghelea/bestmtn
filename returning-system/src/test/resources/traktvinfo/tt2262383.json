Recalling Lamb's command as a military police officer during World War II, the Mayor appeals to his sense of duty to look into a murder of a casino worker -- and so begins Lamb's clash with Vincent Savino, a ruthless Chicago gangster who plans to make Vegas his own. Assisting Lamb in keeping Law And Order are his two deputies: his diplomatic, even-keeled brother Jack  and his charming but impulsive son, Dixon. Ambitious Assistant District Attorney Katherine O'Connell, who grew up on the ranch next to the Lambs, also lends a hand in preserving justice. In Vegas, two powerful men -- Lamb and Savino -- are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the budding oasis, and for both of them, folding is not an option.
