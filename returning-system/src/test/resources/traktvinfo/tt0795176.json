As the human population has grown, only a quarter of Earth's land now remains uninhabited (aside from Antarctica). Although around 12% is protected, this may not be enough \u2014 providing such places are not just 'enclosures' and bordering territories are also managed. Ethiopia's Semien Mountains are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of overpopulation. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their natural resources is also important.","first_aired":1165132800,"first_aired_iso":"2006-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1165104000,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/planet-earth/specials/episode/19","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/217-0-19.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/217-0-19.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":100,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0}},{"season":0,"episode":20,"number":20,"tvdb_id":3535851,"title":"Living Together","overview":"The last episode deals with the future of conservation. It begins by looking at previous efforts. The 'Save The Whales' campaign, which started in the 1960s, is seen to have had a limited effect, as whaling continues and fish stocks also decline. In the 1990s, as head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, Richard Leakey took on the poachers by employing armed units. Although it was successful in saving elephants, the policy was detrimental to the Maasai people, who were forced from their land. The need for \"fortress\" areas is questioned, and the recently highlighted Raja Ampat coral reef in Indonesia is an example.","first_aired":1165737600,"first_aired_iso":"2006-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","first_aired_utc":1165708800,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/planet-earth/specials/episode/20","screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/217-0-20.jpg","images":{"screen":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/episodes/217-0-20.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":100,"votes":2,"loved":2,"hated":0}},{"season":0,"episode":21,"number":21,"tvdb_id":4238921,"title":"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth","overview":"Originally aired under BBC Natural World Collection.
