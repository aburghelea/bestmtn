Despite their differences, they are incredible detectives. When things come to a head during their \"seven-year itch\" as partners, their captain forces them into couples' therapy to save their \"work marriage\" and the one thing they both love -- law enforcement.  Travis Marks (Michael Ealy) and Wes Mitchell (Warren Kole) are two partners who -- apart from their polarity and odd couple behavior -- have a seven-year track record as the Los Angeles Police Department's best detectives in the Robbery-Homicide Division.  Since their constant bickering is interfering with work, their new-age captain (Jack McGee) -- who found counseling changed his life -- sends them to couples' therapy. Dr. Ryan (Sonya Walger), a tough-as-nails therapist, tries to help them understand and resolve their conflicts and confront their demons in order to enhance their ability to work together solving crimes. They soon learn that a successful relationship or partnership doesn't mean you have to like the same things; you just have to hate the same things and sometimes that makes for a stronger union.","runtime":60,"status":"Ended","network":"USA
